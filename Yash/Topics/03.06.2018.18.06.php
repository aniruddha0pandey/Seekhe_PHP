// In PHP a variable is initiated with a '$' Dollar sign. It's bucket to hold information.

<?php
  $eerie = "Did you hear Laurel?"; // Use quoted text to show a string of letters;
  $t = 4;
  $h = 34.3;
  echo "Hi";
// echo is an output variable.
  echo "I have $t chocolates"; //Output: I have 4 chocolates.
//______________________________________________________________________________________________________
  echo "I have" .$t. "chocolates"; //Output: I have 4 chocolates
//______________________________________________________________________________________________________
// Arithmetic operations in PHP
  echo $t + $34.3
?>

<!-- Note that in PHP you need not to worry about the data-type of the variable you're using. PHP identifies it automatically unlike C/C++.-->
